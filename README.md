# SolarStatistics

Imagine we have a site that displays efficiency statistics of client solar power plant. What you need to do is to create a registration form using our provided design and create as much frontend as you can. Keep in mind - Quality and argumentation first.

Task should take no longer than 6h. All visuals including assets will be provided in Figma which we use daily in PVcase. 

## Stack we expect you will use:
- React
- PostCSS || SCSS || SASS || CSS

## We will judge:
- Semantic HTML, 
- Accesibility, 
- knowledge of CSS, 
- React state handling, 
- ES5+

## Submision: 
After you've finished - push to your git and send a public link to a recruiter. We will take care of the rest. 

Have a lot of fun and feel free to share anything with us!
